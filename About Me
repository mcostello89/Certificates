Hello there-

Join me on my pathway towards CISO leadership and to further strengthen expertise in security governance and compliance.
Currently making great strides in obtaining Sec+, CGRC, CISSP, CEH, and IBM Cyber Analyst certificates whilst diving headlong into Gen AI, Machine Learning, and Prompt Engineering
These certificates are showcasing my coursework/continuing education as I complete them. 

I am an Operations & Risk Management Leader with 15+ years in technical operations and a focus on secure access governance, compliance program management, and cloud security assurance. 
Proven ability to operationalize the shared responsibility model during cloud migrations, ensuring both risk mitigation and regulatory alignment. 
Adept at bridging technical teams, operations, and executives to deliver scalable, compliance-driven workflows that protect sensitive data and enable business continuity. 
Experienced in driving cross-functional security initiatives, optimizing operational processes, and embedding compliance into large-scale programs. 

Thanks for stopping by!
